# Contrail: real-time data visualization with react.js & d3

![alt text]()

## Accessing the site:

You can either access the deployed site or, clone and run locally. Since the deployed site sometimes acts weirdly, 
make sure to check out the local version if you suspect something isn't quite right!

### Deployed Site:

For convenience, the site is deployed [here](http://react-with-d3.surge.sh/).

### Running Locally:

- first `git clone`
- `cd` into root directory of repo, and enter `npm install`
- type `npm run start` into the command line
- open `http://localhost:8000/`
